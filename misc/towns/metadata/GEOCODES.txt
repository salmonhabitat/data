  Description:
    Abstract: GEOCODES is a table that  lists standardized names and unique identifiers for Maine minor civil divisions and reservations, which represents the first official Standard Geographic Code endorsed and adopted by the Governor of Maine, on July 1, 1971. Geocodes have undergone subsequent revisions, all of  which were "officially" rolled back to this 1971 list by Maine's Information Services Policy Board (ISPB), as of January 2000. In 1971, all Maine state agencies were requested to implement these five digit geocodes, in agency information systems, to build a base of data for Maine and to promote data sharing. Fields include: COMMONNAME, COUNTY, GEOCODE, STATUS, CODE1982, CODE1971, NOTES. The first two digits of the geocode represent the federal code (FIPS55-3) for Maine counties, the remaining three digits were assigned by Maine to uniquely identify each of Maine's MCDs and Reservations. As an information service to state agencies and the public, and in cooperation with the Maine State Planning Office, these "official" geocodes for Maine, are now maintained, updated and made available through the Maine Office of Geographic Information Systems (MEGIS). Periodic revision is necessary to reflect changes that occur, for example incorporation of a new minor civil division  in 1998 required the addition of a new geocode. All fields are data type TEXT.
    Purpose: The table provides unique identifiers and standardized names for Maine minor civil divisions and reservations. The table is used in the Maine GIS Data Catalog for the "Select by Town" and "Select by County" pick lists.
