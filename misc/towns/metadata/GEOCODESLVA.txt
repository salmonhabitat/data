	Description:  
		Abstract:  GEOCODESLVA is a table that lists names of Maine settlements, locations, unincorporated villages (L), incorporated villages (V), alternate names (A), with GEOCODE, 1971. Fields include: LVANAME, COUNTY, GEOCODE, STATUS.  Information for this table was drawn from "Standard Geographic Code for Minor Civil Divisions by County", published by the Maine State Planning Office, August 1982. For additional information on locations, villages and alternate names see http://megis.maine.gov/ for a "GIS Link" to the Maine State Archives "Maine Minor Civil Divisions Legal History Database". All fields are data type TEXT.
		Purpose:  The table provides a list of village corporations, settlements, locations, unincorporated villages and alternate names. "Any place name which has been assigned the letter code V is a legally existing though not necessarily operationally active village corporation....The letter code A is used for alternate names of an MCD. The code is used where there has been a change of name. For example Sabattus was changed from Webster. It is also used where an unorganized MCD has become incorporated. For example, Jerusalem Twp incorporated to become the Town of Carrabassett Valley. A third usage is where a MCD may be known by more than one name." (Standard Geographic Code for Minor Civil Division by County, published by the Maine State Planning Office, August 1982)
