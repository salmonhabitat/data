  Description:
    Abstract: GEOMCDCCD is a table that  lists GEOCODES by the US Census Bureau COUSUB number, a unique ID for USCB census county divisions (CCDs). The file can be related to METWP24, METWP100, and METWP250 on the field GEOCODE. Fields in GEOMCDCCD include: SUMLEV, STATEFIPS, COUNTY, COUNTYFIPS, COUSUBNAME, COUSUB, COUSUBNUM, TOWN, GEOCODE, STATUS, GEOCODENUM, POP00, SQM, POPDEN00_SQM, ACRES. Populations for unorganized minor civil divisions, reported by USCB as UT groups, were derived by spatial join of BLKS00 centroids with METWP24. The centroid analysis cannot be exact, Census blocks in the UT groups extend beyond minor civil division boundaries. Average size of Census blocks in the UT groups is one square mile. Relate fields are data type TEXT, statistical fields including POP00, SQM, POPDEN00_SQM, ACRES, COUSUBNUM, GEOCODENUM are data type NUMBER.
    Purpose: The table provides a cross reference between the standard geocode for Maine minor civil divisions and reservations, and U.S. Census Bureau identifiers for census county subdivisions.  PLEASE NOTE: there is often no direct 1:1 relationship between minor civil division boundaries and census county divisions or other Census geographic units. The rural character of Maine, and especially northern Maine, often requires the USCB to report counts and tabulations over larger areas for statistical reasons and for reasons of confidentiality. The USCB redefines these areas as population shifts.

      Other_Citation_Details: MCDCCD00 was created to facilitate mapping, analysis, and use of Census 2000 data with other Maine GIS data layers. To extend analysis to other Maine GIS data layers, a table GEOMCDCCD has been created for use with the coverage METWP24. GEOMCDCCD provides a crosswalk between Standard Geocodes for Maine Minor Civil Divisions and the Census County Division FIPS code COUSUB00 in MCDCCD00. The table is published and available for download through the "Tables" link of the MEGIS internet Data Catalog.
