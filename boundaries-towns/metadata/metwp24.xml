<descript>
<abstract>METWP24 depicts political boundaries, common town names, and geocodes for Maine at 1:24,000 scale. The coverage was created from USGS, 7.5 minute map series, town boundaries. The Maine GIS base layer COAST, which contains Maine's coastal Mean High Water (MHW) mark and Maine islands, was used in the development of METWP24. To correct mapping errors and reflect recent changes to Minor Civil Division (MCD) boundaries, arcs and polygons have been added to or updated in METWP24 from: photorevised USGS data; Maine GIS base layer coincident features; legal descriptions; GPS data; and Maine Department of Transportation (MEDOT) engineering plans. METWP24 contains USGS 1:100,000 scale data and U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Census, TIGER Line Files 1990 and 2000 where these provide a more correct or best available representation of a dataset feature.</abstract>
<purpose>METWP24 was created to show political boundaries, common town names and Maine geocodes at 1:24,000 scale. Data at this scale is suitable for detailed studies and local planning. Not for use in scales greater than 1:24000.</purpose>

<logic>Spatial topology meets "Data Standards for Maine Geographic Information Systems", June 2002.  An offshore limit line - Originally drafted at 1:250,000 by the Bureau of Land management (BLM) for managing Federal Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) leasing programs, the protraction diagram limit line was later plotted at 1:100,000 scale and provided in digital form to the US Census Bureau for use their TIGER Line Files. While this line is located approximately three nautical miles from the shoreline, it is technically the protraction diagram limit line not the actual three mile limit line and is used for closure purposes only in Maine GIS maps depicting coastal waters of Maine. Where reliable data for the depiction of  town boundaries beyond the coastline were not available, lines called connectors or arcs that extend from the coastline to this offshore limit line were added to METWP24 to correct query results for specific applications and for cartographic purposes. They are easily removed from the line feature class by selecting all arcs coded TYPE = connector and from the polygon feature class by selecting only features where LAND = 'y'.</logic>

<othercit>This citation is for the first official Standard Geographic Code endorsed and adopted by the Governor of Maine, on July 1, 1971. Geocodes have undergone subsequent revisions, all of  which were "officially" rolled back to this 1971 list by Maine's Information Services Policy Board (ISPB), as of January 2000. In 1971, all Maine state agencies were requested to implement these five digit geocodes, in agency information systems, to build a base of data for Maine's Minor Civil Divisions (MCDs) and to promote data sharing. Data coded by MCD may subsequently be summarized by any other type of region, administrative district, natural area, etc. The first two digits of the geocode represent the federal code (FIPS) for Maine counties, the remaining three digits uniquely identify each of Maine's MCDs and Reservations. As an information service to state agencies and the public, geocodes for Maine, are now maintained, updated and made available for download, in comma delimited text and .dbf format, through the Maine Office of Geographic Information Systems (MEGIS) Data Catalog at  http://megis.maine.gov/catalog/ , "Tables" link.</othercit>

<othercit>Publication date is unique to each quadrangle in the map series. Standard 30x60 minute quadrangles cover geographic areas of 1578 to 2167 square miles. 1 inch at map scale represents 1.6 miles. The following information from the Mid-continent Mapping Center (MCMC) may be pertinent in the use of 100k data: "The 100k quadrangles were primarily produced using 15 minute copy. However, P (provisional) maps and other 7.5 minute copy were also used."</othercit>

<srccontr>Data, from the U.S. Department of Commerce Bureau of Census 1:100000 TIGER Line Files 1990 were used, in METWP24, to represent the offshore limit line and where TIGER features provided the best known representation of a town or reservation boundary. The following information on the origin and accuracy of the offshore limit line was provided by USGS: "According to USGS preliminary policy directive, dated January 6, 1977, the offshore protraction survey data (offshore limit line represented in METWP24) was originally shown only on 1:250000 scale topographic/bathymetric maps. In response to additional user requirements the decision was later made to show this data on all 1:100000 and 1:250000 scale maps regardless of the availability of bathymetry (Supplemental Topographic Instruction (STI 80/2/C, March 17, 1980). The offshore protraction surveys were prepared by the Bureau of Land management (BLM) for managing Federal Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) leasing programs. The protraction surveys were plotted by BLM at 1:250000 scale to produce the OCS Official Protraction Diagrams. In October 1982, the responsibility for preparing leasing maps was transferred from BLM to the Minerals Management Service (STI 83-5-C, August 26, 1983). The Information was plotted on 1:100,000 scale maps from copy that was enlarged from the 1:250000 scale graphics. The information on the 100,000 scale maps was provided in digital form to the Census Bureau for their TIGER Line Files. The offshore protraction diagram limit line parallel to the shoreline on the Official Protraction Diagrams is not identified as a territorial limit line or labeled on USGS maps as the three mile or three league line. While this line is located approximately three nautical miles from the shoreline, it is technically the protraction diagram limit line, not the actual three mile limit line.  . . .the protraction limit line . . . can only be as accurate as the original source (BLM Official Protraction Diagrams).</srccontr>

<othercit>TIGERS (Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing) are a public product of the Bureau of the Census. TIGERS represent a digital database of geographic features, such as roads, railroads, rivers, lakes, political boundaries, census statistical boundaries, etc. covering the entire United States. The database contains information about these features such as their location in latitude and longitude, the type of feature, the geographic relationship to other features, and other related information. In order for others to use the information in the Census TIGER database in a geographic information system (GIS), the Census Bureau releases periodic extracts of the database, including the TIGER/Line Files, to the public.

<othercit>Recommended FM items, FMSRC, FMSRCDAT, FMSRCORG, FMPROCSS, FMUPDORG, FMUPDDAT, and suggested codes provide accessible readable standardized notation on the source, source originator, process, organization of edit, and date of edit that identify a feature's location and quality. The codes are in English, all lowercase and include no hyphens, punctuation or spaces. Codes have standardized definitions so their use represents a single unique defined source, source originator, process, or organization of edit. The Maine GIS Technical Group's FM subcommittee has defined these items for use in feature attribute tables. The final recommendation, which was presented January 2001, is flexible and will function in most GIS environments independent of FGDC metadata or specific metadata tools; however, parallel or subsequent development of FGDC metadata, and use of cross references to same, is assumed and recommended. For more information on the Maine GIS Feature Metadata Recommendation see: http://www.megis.maine.gov/standards/standards.asp/, Standards &amp; Guidelines.</othercit>

<procdesc>The Maine Office of GIS completed the conversion of all final data layers from NAD27 to NAD83 in July 1999.  All the data layers were converted using the ArcInfo (version 7.2.1) NADCON conversion and the "project" command.  All data was copied to double precision, projected to NAD83, and then copied back to single precision.  It was decided to keep the NAD27 quad structure instead of generating new quad boundaries from NAD83 coordinates - all indexes (quads) were projected to NAD83 by using the same process previously described.  All MEGIS data libraries in ArcInfo Librarian were repopulated using the NAD83 indexes and data.</procdesc>

<procdesc>Attribute changes:
Starting with the DOT copy of METWP24, from September 2001, a regions coverage:
dropped items DOTGEOCODE (2 discrepancies with GEOCODE Barnard DOTGEOCODE was 21892 (82) sb 21030 (71) and Grand Falls DOTGEOCODE was 19838 (82) sb 19250(71)), CMI_OLD, CMI, CMITAG, COUNTY_ID, COUNTY-ID, USCONG_DIS to create a coverage that includes MEDOT attribution requirements, this coverage will be serve as an updated SDE layer;
BAXTER attributes corrected from boolean values (1,0) to 'y' and 'n';
added attribute 'other' to item TYPE for features within town boundaries, i.e. BSP, lurc, reservations, that do not represent 'town', 'county', 'state', 'coastline', 'connectors', or 'offshore';
EGGROCK CIREG 63-333 sb LURC = 'y';

<procdesc>METWP24 has been edited with information provided by Hallowell and Farmingdale on their boundary west of Water Street/Maine Avenue. Letter from Chief Rodney Myrick, Hallowell 03/17/2004 indicates both municipalities are in agreement that at the "bend on Chickadee Lane" the boundary line running northeasterly from Blaine Road should "cross over to the north side [of Chickadee Lane and run] all the way down to Water Street".

For this area, many points, features and historic references in PS1852Ch549, An Act to Incorporate the Town of Farmingdale, have been lost. Both towns have referred to a plan of the area by Ansel L. Hill, dated February 7, 1972. The "Old Stone Monuments" documented in the Hill plan have also not been located. Digital mapping cannot rectify this, or substitute for resurvey and clarification of the boundary; however, map changes based on the information provided may be a better approximation of what the municipalities agree is their historical boundary than the current USGS depiction.

The intersection of Chickadee Lane with Water Street/Maine Avenue appears to be within 10 meters of the location of an old stone monument shown on the Hill plan marked "F on S'ly side and H on N'ly side".  E911 GPS data for Chickadee Lane has been used to depict a line running west from that intersection to an approximate point of intersection with a line running northeasterly from Blaine Road.</procdesc>

Improved CIREG number coding, island identification and depicition, the result of a multiagency coordination effort for the 1:24000 scale base layers, was added to METWP24. The work was completed for HYD24P in 2003.

SUMMARY Islands3 Coverage
7200 mapped features
6995 mapped islands or ledges (2016 of which have names derived from USGS 15' quads)
1281 Maine islands or ledges with an identifier added 
35 Canadian islands with CA prefix and an identifier greater than or equal to 1000 [added see MEIFW email JKenney 06/26/2003]
 -  New Hampshire islands with with NH prefix and an identifier greater than or equal to 1000 ["]
5679 Maine islands or ledges with an identifier, 5473 of which are unique identifiers (some identifiers point to multiple polygons - e.g. ledges).
3671 Maine islands or ledges with an identifier listed in the Coastal Island Registry, 3471 of which are unique identifiers (some identifiers point to multiple polygons - e.g. ledges).
2008 Maine islands or ledges with an identifier assigned by the College of the Atlantic, 2002 of which are unique identifiers (some identifiers point to multiple polygons - e.g. ledges).
621 added polygons - 114 from the "Coast" layer, 505 from DRGs or DOQs (heads-up digitizing), 2 from the revised "Coast" layer, which is based on newer USGS quads for Moose River, Cutler, Machias Bay, Cross Island (provided by David Kirouac) 

ATTRIBUTES
IslandID (C16) - This field contains all of the verified Coastal Island Registry identifiers and the identifiers added by the College of the Atlantic. All coastal features were assigned an ISLANDID. Those previously indicated "No ID" have been assigned an identifier greater than or equal to 1000 [added see MEIFW email JKenney 06/26/2003]. Canadian islands - with CA prefix and an identifier greater than or equal to 1000 ["]
New Hampshire islands -  with with NH prefix and an identifier greater than or equal to 1000. ["] 
All Coastal Island Registry identifiers in this layer match the Coastal Island Registry identifiers on the paper maps at the Department of conservation and the Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife.

All future assignments of ISLANDID should be made through MEIFW.</procdesc>

<procdesc>Regarding Island of Moosehead Lake, Piscataquis County Geocode 21000.

The laws describing the boundaries of Piscataquis County defined the western boundary as containing all of the Lake itself, and "all islands that lay therein" (or something to that effect), so the islands are defined by statute as belonging to the county.  They are not included in the legal descriptions for any of the shoreland towns, therefore, It was decided in the early years of GIS in Maine (1999) to assign the general Piscataquis 21000 number to the islands.</procdesc>

<overview>
<eaover>POLYGONS in METWP24 are attributed with the items TOWN, COUNTY, GEOCODE, and CNTYCODE as found in  "Standard Geographic Codes for Maine Minor Civil Divisions". Like COAST, METWP24 contains the item CIREG flagging those islands whose ISLANDID is also a Maine Department of Conservation, Bureau of Parks and Lands, Coastal Island Registry (CIREG) number. POLYGONS in the coverage are also attributed with the items LAND, ISLAND, ISLANDID, LURC, BAXTER and TAG. ARCS are coded with the items LAND, TYPE, and with Maine GIS recommended feature metadata (FM) items and codes. Initially FM items were coded from the item SOURCE, which has been dropped, and FM items are now maintained with current information as the data is edited. The FM items provide the most specific and accessible  information about the sources for location line features, polygon boundaries and arcs, in the data.  For more information on Maine GIS Feature Metadata Recommendation and "Standard Geocodes for Maine Minor Civil Divisions" see the Standards &amp; Guildelines link. You may contact the Maine Office of GIS at 207 624-7700 for technical assistance.</eaover>
<eadetcit>The  ArcView shapefile and ArcGIS geodatabase formats, commonly used for Maine GIS data, carry default identifiers and attributes that are software generated and/or important for internal recordkeeping. These are listed here to avoid repetition for every layer, and may not be repeated in the attribute descriptions and definitions of each layer. Common software generated identifiers and attributes in Maine GIS data include: FID (feature identifier), Shape (feature geometry), OBJECTID and SHAPE_lengt.  In addition, most GIS formats will carry fields for PERIMETER, AREA and/or LENGTH according to feature geometry. These fields are typically available by default, with the units based on coordinate system or projection units of GIS data. Most GIS software packages also provide a means to calculate these values. It is important to test any columns containing PERIMETER, AREA or LENGTH values before using them for analysis purposes. These important values can be carried from format to format and become out-dated. Verify that the values are correct. Also, in your GIS software, please view the properties of data layers for the map units used to calculate these fields, and for the units set for display purposes.</eadetcit>

<formcont>MEGIS has all vector layers in the Maine GIS Internet Data Catalog available in ESRI's ArcGIS shapefile format. A shapefile is a simple non-topological format that stores the geometry and attribute information for a set of geographic features as a set of vector (point, line, polygon) coordinates. Shapefiles draw quickly and directly in ArcView, ArcGIS, ArcExplorer. Shapefiles are a compatible data type for many other types of GIS software. Three files are fundamental to each shapefile: .shp stores the feature geometry (shape and location information); .shx stores the index of the feature geometry; .dbf a dBASE (TM) file stores the attribute information for the features. Other index files may be created to help speed analysis and query: these file formats are .sbn  .sbx  .ain .aix .fbn and .fbx. In addition you may find projection .prj, and metadata .xml, files associated with shapefiles.</formcont>
