The coverage was created from USGS, 7.5 minute map series, town boundaries. The Maine GIS base layer COAST, which contains Maine's coastal Mean High Water (MHW) mark and Maine islands, was used in the development of METWP24. To correct mapping errors and reflect recent changes to Minor Civil Division (MCD) boundaries, arcs and polygons have been added to or updated in METWP24 from: photorevised USGS data; Maine GIS base layer coincident features; legal descriptions; GPS data; and Maine Department of Transportation (MEDOT) engineering plans. METWP24 contains USGS 1:100,000 scale data and U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Census, TIGER Line Files 1990 and 2000 where these provide a more correct or best available representation of a dataset feature.</abstract><purpose>METWP24 was created to show political boundaries, common town names and Maine geocodes at 1:24,000 scale.

An offshore limit line - Originally drafted at 1:250,000 by the Bureau of Land management (BLM) for managing Federal Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) leasing programs, the protraction diagram limit line was later plotted at 1:100,000 scale and provided in digital form to the US Census Bureau for use their TIGER Line Files. While this line is located approximately three nautical miles from the shoreline, it is technically the protraction diagram limit line not the actual three mile limit line and is used for closure purposes only in Maine GIS maps depicting coastal waters of Maine. Where reliable data for the depiction of  town boundaries beyond the coastline were not available, lines called connectors or arcs that extend from the coastline to this offshore limit line were added to METWP24 to correct query results for specific applications and for cartographic purposes. They are easily removed from the line feature class by selecting all arcs coded TYPE = connector and from the polygon feature class by selecting only features where LAND = 'y'.</logic><complete>Data set is complete.</complete><posacc><horizpa><horizpar>Approximate horizontal accuracy is 12 meters plus or minus 40 feet, assuming source data meets National Map Accuracy Standards.</horizpar><qhorizpa><horizpav>12</horizpav><horizpae>Horizontal positional accuracy for this digital data is tested by visual comparison to the source with hard copy plots.</horizpae></qhorizpa></horizpa></posacc><lineage><srcinfo><srccite><citeinfo><origin>U.S. Geological Survey (USGS)</origin><pubdate>multiple dates</pubdate><pubtime>Unknown</pubtime><title>(24k) USGS 1:24,000 scale quadrangles</title><geoform>map</geoform><serinfo><sername>National Mapping Program Standard Series Topographic Maps</sername><issue>USGS 7.5 Minute Map Series</issue></serinfo><pubinfo><pubplace>Reston VA</pubplace><publish>U.S. Geological Survey</publish></pubinfo><othercit>24000 Publication date is unique to each quadrangle in the map series.

Geocodes have undergone subsequent revisions, all of  which were "officially" rolled back to this 1971 list by Maine's Information Services Policy Board (ISPB), as of January 2000. In 1971, all Maine state agencies were requested to implement these five digit geocodes, in agency information systems, to build a base of data for Maine's Minor Civil Divisions (MCDs) and to promote data sharing. Data coded by MCD may subsequently be summarized by any other type of region, administrative district, natural area, etc. The first two digits of the geocode represent the federal code (FIPS) for Maine counties, the remaining three digits uniquely identify each of Maine's MCDs and Reservations. As an information service to state agencies and the public, geocodes for Maine, are now maintained, updated and made available for download, in comma delimited text and .dbf format, through the Maine Office of Geographic Information Systems (MEGIS) Data Catalog at  http://megis.maine.gov/catalog/ , "Tables" link.</othercit><onlink>http://megis.maine.gov/catalog/</onlink></citeinfo></srccite><srctime><timeinfo><sngdate><caldate>19710701</caldate><time>Unknown</time></sngdate></timeinfo><srccurr>publication date</srccurr></srctime><srccitea>geocode</srccitea><srccontr>Minor Civil Division and Reservation boundary POLYGONS in METWP24 are coded with the GEOCODE a unique 5 digit integer code for MCDs and Reservations in Maine.</srccontr></srcinfo><srcinfo><srccite><citeinfo><origin>U.S. Geological Survey (USGS)</origin><pubdate>multiple dates</pubdate><pubtime>Unknown</pubtime><title>(100k) USGS 1:100000 scale quadrangles</title><geoform>map</geoform><serinfo><sername>National Mapping Program Standard Series Topographic Maps</sername><issue>USGS 30 x 60 Minute Map Series</issue></serinfo><pubinfo><pubplace>Reston VA</pubplace><publish>U.S. Geological Survey</publish></pubinfo><othercit>Publication date is unique to each quadrangle in the map series.

The following information on the origin and accuracy of the offshore limit line was provided by USGS: "According to USGS preliminary policy directive, dated January 6, 1977, the offshore protraction survey data (offshore limit line represented in METWP24) was originally shown only on 1:250000 scale topographic/bathymetric maps. In response to additional user requirements the decision was later made to show this data on all 1:100000 and 1:250000 scale maps regardless of the availability of bathymetry (Supplemental Topographic Instruction (STI 80/2/C, March 17, 1980). The offshore protraction surveys were prepared by the Bureau of Land management (BLM) for managing Federal Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) leasing programs. The protraction surveys were plotted by BLM at 1:250000 scale to produce the OCS Official Protraction Diagrams. In October 1982, the responsibility for preparing leasing maps was transferred from BLM to the Minerals Management Service (STI 83-5-C, August 26, 1983). The Information was plotted on 1:100,000 scale maps from copy that was enlarged from the 1:250000 scale graphics. The information on the 100,000 scale maps was provided in digital form to the Census Bureau for their TIGER Line Files. The offshore protraction diagram limit line parallel to the shoreline on the Official Protraction Diagrams is not identified as a territorial limit line or labeled on USGS maps as the three mile or three league line. While this line is located approximately three nautical miles from the shoreline, it is technically the protraction diagram limit line, not the actual three mile limit line.  . . .the protraction limit line . . . can only be as accurate as the original source (BLM Official Protraction Diagrams).</srccontr></srcinfo><srcinfo><srccite><citeinfo><origin>Maine Office of Geographic Information Systems (MEGIS)</origin><pubdate>20010601</pubdate><pubtime>Unknown</pubtime><title>metwp100</title><geoform>vector digital data</geoform><serinfo><sername>Maine GIS</sername><issue>SDE server; Internet Data Catalog</issue></serinfo><pubinfo><pubplace>Augusta ME</pubplace><publish>Maine Office of Geographic Information Systems</publish></pubinfo><othercit>1:100000</othercit><onlink>http://megis.maine.gov/catalog/</onlink></citeinfo></srccite><srcscale>100000</srcscale><typesrc>online</typesrc><srctime><timeinfo><rngdates><begdate>19480101</begdate><begtime>Unknown</begtime><enddate>20010501</enddate><endtime>Unknown</endtime></rngdates></timeinfo><srccurr>source dates</srccurr></srctime><srccitea>metwp100</srccitea><srccontr>Data, from the Maine Office of Geographic Information Systems (MEGIS) 1:100000 town boundary coverage METWP100, were used, in METWP24, where features provided the best known representation of a town or reservation boundary.</srccontr></srcinfo><srcinfo><srccite><citeinfo><origin>U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), Maine Office of Geographic Information Systems (MEGIS) (comp., ed.)</origin><pubdate>1995</pubdate><pubtime>Unknown</pubtime><title>coast</title><geoform>vector digital data</geoform><serinfo><sername>Maine GIS</sername><issue>SDE server; Internet Data Catalog</issue></serinfo><pubinfo><pubplace>Augusta ME</pubplace><publish>Maine Office of Geographic Information Systems (MEGIS)</publish></pubinfo><othercit>1:24000</othercit></citeinfo></srccite><srcscale>24000</srcscale><typesrc>online</typesrc><srctime><timeinfo><rngdates><begdate>1948</begdate><begtime>Unknown</begtime><enddate>1999</enddate><endtime>Unknown</endtime></rngdates></timeinfo><srccurr>source dates</srccurr></srctime><srccitea>coast</srccitea><srccontr>Data, from the Maine Office of Geographic Information Systems (MEGIS) 1:24000 library layer COAST, were used, in METWP24, to represent the Mean High Water (MHW) line, tidal rivers and salt water ponds and where coincident features provided the best known representation a town or reservation boundary.</srccontr></srcinfo><srcinfo><srccite><citeinfo><origin>U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), Maine Office of Geographic Information Systems (MEGIS) (comp., ed.)</origin><pubdate>19970101</pubdate><pubtime>Unknown</pubtime><title>roads</title><geoform>vector digital data</geoform><serinfo><sername>Maine GIS</sername><issue>SDE server; Internet Data Catalog</issue></serinfo><pubinfo><pubplace>Augusta ME</pubplace><publish>Maine Office of Geographic Information Systems (MEGIS)</publish></pubinfo><othercit>Please note this Maine GIS 1:24000 scale ROADS has been updated by the E911 project.

The codes are in English, all lowercase and include no hyphens, punctuation or spaces. Codes have standardized definitions so their use represents a single unique defined source, source originator, process, or organization of edit. The Maine GIS Technical Group's FM subcommittee has defined these items for use in feature attribute tables. The final recommendation, which was presented January 2001, is flexible and will function in most GIS environments independent of FGDC metadata or specific metadata tools; however, parallel or subsequent development of FGDC metadata, and use of cross references to same, is assumed and recommended.

Letter from Chief Rodney Myrick, Hallowell 03/17/2004 indicates both municipalities are in agreement that at the "bend on Chickadee Lane" the boundary line running northeasterly from Blaine Road should "cross over to the north side [of Chickadee Lane and run] all the way down to Water Street".

For this area, many points, features and historic references in PS1852Ch549, An Act to Incorporate the Town of Farmingdale, have been lost. Both towns have referred to a plan of the area by Ansel L. Hill, dated February 7, 1972. The "Old Stone Monuments" documented in the Hill plan have also not been located. Digital mapping cannot rectify this, or substitute for resurvey and clarification of the boundary; however, map changes based on the information provided may be a better approximation of what the municipalities agree is their historical boundary than the current USGS depiction.

The intersection of Chickadee Lane with Water Street/Maine Avenue appears to be within 10 meters of the location of an old stone monument shown on the Hill plan marked "F on S'ly side and H on N'ly side".  E911 GPS data for Chickadee Lane has been used to depict a line running west from that intersection to an approximate point of intersection with a line running northeasterly from Blaine Road.</procdesc><procdate>20040517</procdate><proccont><cntinfo><cntorgp><cntorg>(MEGIS) Maine Office of Geographic Information Systems</cntorg><cntper>GIS Coordinator</cntper></cntorgp><cntpos>GIS Coordinator</cntpos><cntaddr><addrtype>mailing address</addrtype><address>State House Station 174</address><city>Augusta</city><state>ME</state><postal>04333-0174</postal><country>USA</country></cntaddr><cntvoice>207 624-7700</cntvoice><cntfax>207 287-3842</cntfax><hours>Monday through Friday 0800 - 1700 EST</hours></cntinfo></proccont></procstep><procstep><procdesc>METWP24 has been edited with information provided by the Maine Land User Regulation Commission.

A subset of island identifiers are CIREG numbers, which will be indicated by a new CIREG column coded "y/n". Improved CIREG number coding, island identification and depicition, the result of a multiagency coordination effort for the 1:24000 scale base layers, was added to METWP24.

Like COAST, METWP24 contains the item CIREG flagging those islands whose ISLANDID is also a Maine Department of Conservation, Bureau of Parks and Lands, Coastal Island Registry (CIREG) number. POLYGONS in the coverage are also attributed with the items LAND, ISLAND, ISLANDID, LURC, BAXTER and TAG. ARCS are coded with the items LAND, TYPE, and with Maine GIS recommended feature metadata (FM) items and codes. Initially FM items were coded from the item SOURCE, which has been dropped, and FM items are now maintained with current information as the data is edited. The FM items provide the most specific and accessible  information about the sources for location line features, polygon boundaries and arcs, in the data.  For more information on Maine GIS Feature Metadata Recommendation and "Standard Geocodes for Maine Minor Civil Divisions" see the Standards &amp; Guildelines link. You may contact the Maine Office of GIS at 207 624-7700 for technical assistance.</eaover><eadetcit>The  ArcView shapefile and ArcGIS geodatabase formats, commonly used for Maine GIS data, carry default identifiers and attributes that are software generated and/or important for internal recordkeeping. These are listed here to avoid repetition for every layer, and may not be repeated in the attribute descriptions and definitions of each layer. Common software generated identifiers and attributes in Maine GIS data include: FID (feature identifier), Shape (feature geometry), OBJECTID and SHAPE_lengt.  In addition, most GIS formats will carry fields for PERIMETER, AREA and/or LENGTH according to feature geometry. These fields are typically available by default, with the units based on coordinate system or projection units of GIS data. Most GIS software packages also provide a means to calculate these values. It is important to test any columns containing PERIMETER, AREA or LENGTH values before using them for analysis purposes. These important values can be carried from format to format and become out-dated. Verify that the values are correct. Also, in your GIS software, please view the properties of data layers for the map units used to calculate these fields, and for the units set for display purposes.</eadetcit></overview></eainfo><distinfo><distrib><cntinfo><cntorgp><cntorg>(MEGIS) Maine Office of Geographic Information Systems</cntorg></cntorgp><cntpos>GIS Coordinator</cntpos><cntaddr><addrtype>mailing address</addrtype><address>State House Station 174</address><city>Augusta</city><state>ME</state><postal>04333-0174</postal><country>USA</country></cntaddr><cntvoice>207 624-7700</cntvoice><cntfax>207 287-3842</cntfax><hours>Monday through Friday 0800 - 1700 EST</hours></cntinfo></distrib><resdesc>Downloadable Data</resdesc><distliab>Users must assume responsibility to determine the usability of this data for their purposes.

A shapefile is a simple non-topological format that stores the geometry and attribute information for a set of geographic features as a set of vector (point, line, polygon) coordinates. Shapefiles draw quickly and directly in ArcView, ArcGIS, ArcExplorer. Shapefiles are a compatible data type for many other types of GIS software. Three files are fundamental to each shapefile: .shp stores the feature geometry (shape and location information); .shx stores the index of the feature geometry; .dbf a dBASE (TM) file stores the attribute information for the features. Other index files may be created to help speed analysis and query: these file formats are .sbn  .sbx  .ain .aix .fbn and .fbx. In addition you may find projection .prj, and metadata .xml, files associated with shapefiles.</formcont><filedec>Data available from this website is in .zip compressed format.
