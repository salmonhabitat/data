_datasets relevant to anadromous species restoration in Maine_

If you're just looking to browse the data and see what's available, just click on the files. Otherwise, I'd suggest you take a look at [this fantastic guide](http://blog.geomusings.com/2013/06/18/geojson-on-github-now-what/) put together by [@billdollins](https://twitter.com/billdollins). Inspired by [Git and Github for data](http://blog.okfn.org/2013/07/02/git-and-github-for-data/).
